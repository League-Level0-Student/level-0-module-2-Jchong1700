Random Checkpoint
On paper, write code that does the following: 
1. Get a random whole number that is less than 1,000.

Random wholeNumber = new Random();
int number = wholeNumber.nextInt(999);

2. Get another random whole number that is less than 900.


int newNumber = wholeNumber.nextInt(899);

3. Print:
          a) What happens when you add the numbers , e.g. 99 + 64 = 163 
          
          System.out.println(number += newNumber);
          
          b) What happens when you subtract the numbers , e.g. 99-64 = 35 

          System.out.println(number -= newNumber);
