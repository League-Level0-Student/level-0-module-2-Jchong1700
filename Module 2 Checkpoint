The user is going to make some cookies.
On paper, write code that does the following:

1. Ask the user how many cups of flour they have. If they have less than 2 cups, tell
them to go to the store to buy more.

String flour = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("How many cups of flour do you have?");
	int numFlour = Integer.parseInt(flour);

if(numFlour < 2){ JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Go to the store and buy more");

2. Now ask them how many people they are going to give cookies to. If they are going
to give cookies to more than 30 people, tell them they are going to have to bake two
batches of cookies! 

String friends = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("How many people are you going to give cookies to?");
	int numFriends = Integer.parseInt(friends);
	
	if(numFriends > 30){JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "You're going to need 2 batches of cookies!");

3. Finally, ask them how many batches of cookies they baked. If they baked 2 batches
of cookies, tell them they are lucky to have so many friends. 

String batches = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("How many batches of cookies did you make?");
	int numBatches = Integer.parseInt(batches);
	
	if(numBatches == 2){JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "You're lucky to have so many friends.");
